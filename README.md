## 📚 Topics Covered

### Assignment 1: Arrays
- Basic array operations (insert, delete, search)
- Array traversal
- Index-based access

### Assignment 2: Recursion  
- Fibonacci sequence
- Factorial calculation
- String reversal
- Sum of digits

### Assignment 3: Data Structures
- **Lists:** Mutable, ordered, allows duplicates
- **Tuples:** Immutable, ordered, allows duplicates
- **Sets:** Mutable, unordered, no duplicates
- **Dictionaries:** Key-value pairs, mutable

### Assignment 4: Loops
- For loops and patterns
- While loops
- List comprehensions
- Nested loops
- Break/continue statements

## 📝 Quick Reference

### Data Structure Properties
| Type | Mutable? | Ordered? | Duplicates? | Syntax |
|------|----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| List | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | `[]` |
| Tuple | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | `()` |
| Set | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | `{}` |
| Dict | ✅ | ✅ | Keys: ❌ | `{k:v}` |

### When to Use What?
- **List:** When you need ordered, changeable data
- **Tuple:** When you need ordered, unchangeable data  
- **Set:** When you need unique elements only
- **Dict:** When you need key-value relationships

### Recursion vs Iteration
- **Recursion:** Good for naturally recursive problems (trees, math)
- **Iteration:** Better for performance, large datasets

## 🎯 Key Learning Points

1. **Arrays/Lists:** Understanding index-based operations
2. **Recursion:** Base case + recursive case pattern
3. **Data Structures:** Choosing the right tool for the job
4. **Loops:** Different patterns for different problems
5. **Algorithm Efficiency:** When to use which approach

## 📋 Homework Notes
